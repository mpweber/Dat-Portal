# Dat Portal

**dat://datportal.hashbase.io** ( **Only works with the Beaker Browser!** )

The Dat Portal is a way to discover content on dat:// .
The portal is a copy of the livestream project from Paul Frazee. I just changed it a bit.

 - new design (thumbnail of linked site, ...)
 - fork button to easily create your own portal
 - forwarding to dat:// if https:// is used
 - some minor things
 - more coming soon... ( still in development )

Everyone can create their own portal and add it to the Dat Portal. So all users can constantly discover new pages.

## Create your own Portal

Just click on the button **"Create own portal"** and you will automatically copy the original version of Paul Frazee's portal.

### Change and add own links

Simply go to the file portal.json and add your links in the following way:

{
   "title": "GitHub BeakerBrowser",
   "href": "https://github.com/beakerbrowser",
   "date": "June 15, 2018"
 }

 ### Add your portal to the Dat Portal

 Just contact me via GitHub (create an Issue) or Twitter (@mp_weber) and I will add your URL. Please make sure you have uploaded your portal to Hashbase.io. Thus, it is always available. 

## The web ring

Each Portal has a Web ring which we will combine using the Dat Portal.

I will add the URL of your own Portal to the web ring of the Dat Portal. Every link you add in your portal will be visible for everyone in the Dat Portal. Also if you add members to your web ring, all the links will be available in the Dat Portal.
